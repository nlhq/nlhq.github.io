As part of the lease agreement it is typical to collect a security deposit. Depending on your state, there are different laws that govern how large a deposit can be and how you need to handle the money. ([Nolo has a summary of the laws for each state](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/security-deposit-limits-deadlines-your-state-36186.html))

### What is a Security Deposit?
A security deposit provides a landlord some financial assurance to cover potential damages beyond normal wear and tear or non-payment of rent.  

### Handling of Money
While the funds are given to the landlord for holding, the money is still technically the tenants. Rules vary in every state, but In most cases the money should be held in a dedicated account and all interest accrued is the tenants. In some cases, like in NJ, the landlord must provide the tenant with the account information for where the deposit is held.

### Returning Funds
At the end of the lease, the landlord must provide the remainder of the deposit, after any deductions, within a state designated period of time. If deductions are taken, the landlord must provide an itemized list of all deductions. This is where documentation of move-in and move-out conditions are critical for justification. For each deduction, it is helpful to have actual repair costs or estimates from professionals which leaves less room for contesting the amount of each deduction.

## Deductions
Knowing what to take deductions for can be tricky. Normal wear and tear as well as basic cleaning are not things that a landlord can deduct. It is expected that cleaning will be necessary between tenants, however, if the unit is left excessively dirty then deductions may be taken to cover the additional cleaning. Similarly, some level of repairs are expected due to normal use. Carpets wear out and wall paint gets worn. Each item in your unit has a life expectancy. Once reached, it's hard to justify a deduction for its replacement. However, if due to missuse or negligence, items need replacement or repair, deductions can be taken.

It is critical tonunderstand your state's security deposit laws and follow them strictly. In addition, be diligent about documenting the unit condition prior to move-in. Combined you'll be in a great position and will have added security against negligent tenants.
