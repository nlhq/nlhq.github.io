Late fees are a modest fee, typically around $50, that gets assessed whenever rent is not received by the end of the grace period. The fee and grace period should both be written into the lease.

## Why Late Fees are Important

There are three types of tenants,

1. those who always pay early
2. those who pay during the grace period
3. those who pay late

If you're lucky your tenant it type 1 but odds are you have a type 2. If your unlucky you have a type 3.

With type 3's it's a constant battle to get the rent on-time. This make it challenging to predict cash-flows and so you have to keep extra cash on-hand to deal with the unpredictability. This frustration takes its tool and so your only solace is that you at least can expect an extra late fee each month. Be sure to be consistent charge them. This shouldn't be hard though given the frustration.

With type 2's they typically will get rent in "on time", however, odds are occasionally they'll slip up and be late. Late fees become very important in these situations to ensure your type 2 tenant doesn't become a type 3. It can be easy to blow it off and assume it won't happen again since they always get the payments on time. But this can be a slippery slope if not handled properly. You should follow the lease and charge the full late fee for each occurrence.

Some people like to provide one warning which may be acceptable. However, you should still provide notice to the tenant that the rent was late and future occurrences will result in fees.

I'll be adding an example Late Fee Notice to the Document section soon.

*Laws governing the amount and timing of late fees vary by location. Please review your local laws.*
