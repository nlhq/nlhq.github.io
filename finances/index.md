To be a successful landlord you don&#8217;t have to have a degree in Finance or be a math whiz.  However, you do need to understand the basics of cash flow, setting rent, and recording expenses.  With these basic skills you&#8217;re prepared to be a landlord.

## Cash Flow

Cash flow is simply monitoring your income (or rent) vs. your expenses.  It is important to remember that being a landlord is a business.  And as with all business, you want to maximize profits while minimizing losses.  By keeping track of your cash flow, or estimating it when getting started, you can quickly determine how successful you will be.  This is described in more detail in [Reasons for Being a Landlord][1].

## [Setting Rent][2]

The first half of the cash flow equation is income.  As a landlord, your income is determined by your rent.  Just like with any other business, you get to decide how much to charge for your product.  The hard part is balancing your desired income with a good tenants&#8217; desired rent.  Follow the steps in [Setting Rent][2] to help guide you through the process.

## Expenses

The second half of the cash flow equation are your expenses.  Your expenses are anything that you spend money on that contributes to you renting your property.  Examples of this include: mortgage, interest, taxes, insurance, management fees, maintenance fees, and association fees.  It&#8217;s important to keep track of all of these for two reasons: to assess how successful you are and to account for them when filing your taxes.
