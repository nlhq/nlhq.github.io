Accurately setting the rent for a new rental property is very important.  You need to make sure it&#8217;s set low enough to attract prospective tenants and high enough to allow you to take advantage of the full earning potential of your property.  This requires some research, but with the help of the internet it is completely manageable.

## Describe Your Unit

In order to set the rent for your property, you need to figure out what your property will be worth to potential renters.  The easiest way to do this is to make a list of the characteristics of your property.  Some examples include:

1.  Number of Bedrooms
2.  Number of Bathrooms
3.  Total Square Footage
4.  Number of Floors
5.  Living spaces  &#8211; size and number of rooms
6.  Kitchen Amenities
7.  Washer/ Dryer &#8211; is there one in the unit?
8.  Parking Spaces
9.  Garage/Driveway &#8211; is there one?
10. Size of the Yard &#8211; if there is one
11. External Maintenance  &#8211; is there an association that takes care of it?
12. Local Parks
13. Vicinity to Grocery/Shopping/Emergency Response
14. Local Pools
15. School District

You want to completely understand everything that is good and bad about your unit.  Once you&#8217;ve compiled a comprehensive list, it&#8217;s time to compare to other rentals in your area.  You want to find as many properties as you can that are similar to yours.  It&#8217;s best to find some with more features and some with less to see the full spectrum of rental prices.  Then based on the differences between your unit and the ones you&#8217;ve found, decide where you&#8217;re property fits into that rental spectrum.

## Find Comparable Rentals

The great part about the internet is that there are tons of website that provide local rental listings in your area.  A few examples include:

*   [craigslist][1]
*   [Zillow][2]
*   [trulia][3]
*   [Homes.com][4]
*   [Move.com][5]
*   [Rentals.com][6]
*   [Apartments.com][7]

In general, I like craisglist, Zillow, and trulia.  Zillow and trulia are two of the biggest real estate website and have most (if not all) of the available listed rentals.  These are typically a good benchmark because in most cases they are being listed by a realtor.  I also always check out craigslist because not everyone decides to use a realtor and most people that don&#8217;t will post their property on craiglist.  Many of the sites also allow you to filter the results by a lot of the attributes in your list, which can save you a lot of time finding the ones similar to your unit.  After going through a few of these sites you should have a pretty good idea what you&#8217;re approximate rent should be.

Another good sanity check is to use some online tools to help give you some rough estimates as well.  I wouldn&#8217;t only use these tools, but they are a nice resource to see that you are in the right ballpark.  My preferred tool is Zillow&#8217;s Rent Value Estimate tool which gives you their RentZestimate. There is a widget to the right that will allow you to type in your properties address and get their estimate.  You can also click to get more details and in most cases they&#8217;ll have a historical graph of their estimates over time.  The nice thing about Zillow&#8217;s tool is that it seems to take a lot of factors into account and give a pretty decent estimate.  Currently my Zestimate is within $10 of the rent I&#8217;m charging.

## Urgency

Another factor that could influence your decision is how quickly you are trying to find a new tenant.  If you have a few months it may be worth testing a higher rent and working down as you get closer to your deadline.  But if you are trying to find a new tenant as quickly as possible it may be worth targeting a lower rent to ensure you find someone.  It&#8217;s important to keep in mind the cost of an empty unit.  For example, if you are able to fill the unit with a rent of $1450 immediately or you could fill the unit for $1500 but it&#8217;ll be vacant for an extra month, you&#8217;d be better off renting at $1450.  That way you only lose $600 for the year instead of $1500!

## Set Your Rent

Now it&#8217;s time to take what you&#8217;ve learned and make a decision.  Ultimately you have to decide what you are comfortable with charging.  Every situation is unique and there are a lot of personal factors involved.
