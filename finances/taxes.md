Doing your own taxes can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. Especially if you only have a property or two, doing your own taxes is very manageable with the aide of some software. I always use TurboTax and have been extremely happy, however, I'm sure there is other tax software that's works just as well. The real key to doing your own takes is collecting all the necessary information at the start. As with any business, it breaks down into two categories: Income and Expenses.

### Income
Income is all the money you receive from your properties. Primarily this is the [monthly rent](/finances/rent), however, this could also include any [late fees](/finances/late-fees) or [security deposit deductions](/finances/security-deposits). It's good to keep records of all your income throughout the year. This could be through bank statements, scans of renter checks, or online records if you use a rent collection service (such as [Cozy](http://www.cozy.co)). Gather all your supporting artifacts and sum up your total income. I find it best to create an annual spreadsheet that totals all the income and expenses for easy reference.

### Expenses
Next you'll need to total all your expenses. Depending on the expense, you'll be able to deduct the full amount or you'll need to depreciate the cost over multiple years. Expenses will be lumped into multiple categories but tax software will walk you through it. The key is to account for all your expenses and to try to collect records (bank statement, credit card statements, receipts) of everything.

Once you've gathered everything, I save them all to a folder on Dropbox, then your ready to do your taxes. Just walk through the prompts and you'll be done in no time. The other great part about using tax software over multiple years is that it'll carry over your depreciation and any passive losses that you were unable to previously deduct.
