So you&#8217;ve decided to move and you realize you have a decision to make, should I sell my current house or rent it out?  Typically people sell their homes for many good reasons.  However, there are some compelling reasons to consider converting the home into a rental, depending on your situation.

##  Sellers

If you&#8217;ve lived in your current home for a considerable period of time then hopefully you&#8217;ve built up some nice equity while the home appreciated.  Selling now could mean a significant down payment on your new home.  This could help you get better interest rates on your new mortgage and avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance).  Also, if you&#8217;ve lived in your home for at least 2 years out of the last 5, you can take advantage of up to $500k in tax free capital gains as a couple  (or $250k if you&#8217;re single).  If you decide to rent the property, after 3 years you&#8217;ll no longer be eligible and will need to pay taxes on everything over the depreciated value of the home.  In general, if you have the opportunity to make money off the sale of your home and it&#8217;s been your primary residence you&#8217;ll want to sell.

##  Renters

If you&#8217;re at risk of losing money on the sale of the property then converting to a rental is a very viable alternative.  There are many people, [me included][1], that got hit by the crash in the housing market and found themselves with a home worth less than their current mortgage balance.  This doesn&#8217;t mean you are stuck in that home forever.  You&#8217;ll need to analyze how much you&#8217;d lose by selling and see if it&#8217;s worth it to not have to worry about being a landlord.  If the loss is too great then you can consider renting.  In [Reasons for Becoming a Landlord][2], we discuss the success criteria for movers who can&#8217;t sell.  If you are comfortable with the idea of being a landlord and financially feel you can be successful doing it, then you should strongly consider the possibility.

## Landlords

A few things to consider when thinking about becoming a landlord.

**Pros**

1.  Moving &#8211; It can allow you to move into a new home
2.  Income &#8211; It could potentially provide you with additional income
3.  Equity &#8211; You will continue to gain equity in the property while tenants pay your mortgage

**Cons**

1.  Stress &#8211; you need to find tenants, maintain the property, and maintain financial security
2.  Property destruction &#8211; tenants typically are rough on rentals
3.  Responsibility &#8211; either you&#8217;ll need to be available to your tenants or hire someone to be on a continual basis

If you feel that the pros outweigh the cons for you then start preparing to [rent your home][3].
