This is a very easy step to overlook in the excitement of finding a tenant. But it's critical to document the exact condition of the unit before new tenants move in. I suggest taking lots of pictures or even a video. This is extremely easy to do with your phone. And it will give you piece of mind and the information you need if you must to take security deposit deductions in the future.
