When looking for tenants it&#8217;s important to have a well defined process.  This process will help you make an educated decision when choosing a tenant and will protect you legally by ensuring your criteria are fair.

## 1 &#8211; Establish Guidelines and Write them Down

The first step is establishing your criteria for an acceptable tenant.  These are all the factors that you will rate your tenants on.  It&#8217;s important that you write them down and are thorough.  Some things to consider are:

*   rent vs income percentage
*   how long they&#8217;ve lived in their current place
*   how long they&#8217;ve had their current job
*   do they have pets
*   do they own a water bed
*   how many people plan to live there

## 2 &#8211; Advertise

There are all sorts of options for advertising your rental property.  Some cost money and some are free so you&#8217;ll need to decide how much you&#8217;re willing to spend.  Similar to when [setting rent][1] this could be dependent on your urgency.  At a minimum, use all the free methods available and then evaluate the other options and decide which you think will work best for you.

## 3 &#8211; Phone Screening

Use the phone interview as an opportunity to get to know the person and make sure your unit works for them as well.  Describe the unit and costs to them and ask them questions about the most important criteria on your list.  If they&#8217;re still interested and they meet your criteria then you&#8217;ll want to setup a time to show them the unit.

## 4 &#8211; Show the Property

The showing is a two way interview.  They are evaluating the unit to see if they like it and it&#8217;s worth the rent.  You are trying to learn as much as you can about them.  You want to ask anything that can&#8217;t easily be answered on your application to try to get a good gut feeling about renting to them.  Walk with them around the unit and as you describe it ask them questions.  After you&#8217;re done, you&#8217;ll need to provide them with an application form and explain the process which consists of the form and performing a credit and background check.  It should also include an application fee.

## 5 &#8211; Application

You&#8217;ll need to prepare an application form that asks everything you need to know to make your final decision.  We&#8217;ve provided an [example application][2] which you can use or modify.  It&#8217;s important to review all the information on the submitted applications and try to verify as much as possible.

I recommend that you collect an application fee.  In most states the fee can only be as much as the credit and background checks cost, but this will allow you to only spend your time on serious applicants and can save you a decent penny if you have multiple applicants to consider.

## 6 &#8211; Credit / Background Check

It&#8217;s highly recommended that you perform a credit check at a minimum.  It&#8217;s hard to hide from your credit report and it&#8217;s easy to lie on an application.  There are many services available which typically cost between $20-$30.  Look for large amounts of debt or missed payments because if they have a lot of debt then it&#8217;s likely they&#8217;ll pay off the debt instead of paying you.

## 7 &#8211; Unit Hold & Acceptance

Once you&#8217;ve reviewed their applications and background checks you&#8217;ll need to accept the first applicant who meets your criteria.  This is important because you can&#8217;t discriminate against tenants.

Next you&#8217;ll want to send them a unit hold form.  The form will designate that they intend to rent the unit and includes a fee when they return it.  If they decide to back out the fee is non-refundable, otherwise it goes towards their security deposit.  I&#8217;d recommend setting the fee between a half and a whole month&#8217;s rent depending on how long it will be before they move in.

Once you receive the hold fee and letter you can send them an acceptance letter and a copy of the lease.  It&#8217;s important to provide them the lease ahead of time so that they can fully review it and seek legal counsel, if needed.

## 8 &#8211; Lease Signing

I like to get the lease signed as early as possible because it gives me the peace of mind that the tenant is legally invested in renting the unit.  It can also be reassuring for the tenant because they know you can&#8217;t rent it to anyone else after that point.  If you don&#8217;t already have a lease, I recommend getting one written up as early in the process as possible.  Just be sure it follows all of your state requirements.  At the lease signing I also like to collect the security deposit and first month&#8217;s rent, minus the hold fee.

## 9 &#8211; Move-In

The final step is when your new tenants moves in.  Be sure to greet them at the unit with the keys and welcome them into their new home.  Moving tends to be a big event for people, so make sure you are welcoming and start things off on the right foot.
