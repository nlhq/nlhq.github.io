There a numerous reason you may be considering becoming a new landlord.  It&#8217;s important to understand which category of new landlord you&#8217;d fall into before deciding that it&#8217;s right for you.  The definition for success is different for each and you want to have a good idea whether you can be successful. To evaluate your success criteria you&#8217;ll need to analyze the anticipated monthly income ([rent][1]) versus all the potential expense.  By subtracting the expenses from the income you&#8217;ll know your expected monthly profit or losses.  This is the number that will decide if you are financially successful.

## Real Estate Investors

This is the traditional landlord.  Someone looking to make a profit through real estate.  They decide to actively buy new property specifically with the intent of renting it out.  To be successful as this type of landlord you&#8217;ll want to be making a profit or at a minimum breaking even. The thought for breaking even is that the tenants will be building you equity as they rent and hopefully over time rent will increase.  So while you aren&#8217;t making money immediately, ultimately they will either pay off the mortgage or when you sell you&#8217;ll earn all the equity they have been building for you. This is similar to the arguments for buying a home instead of renting one yourself.  Initial costs are potential high for this type of landlord because they&#8217;ll need a down payment and to cover closing costs.

## Movers Who Can&#8217;t Sell

The second type of landlord is one who is planning to move.  Maybe they want to upgrade or downsize or their being relocated for work.  While most people don&#8217;t give it much thought, when looking to move there is always the question of what to do with your current home. The traditional thought is to sell it. In many cases this is also the best answer. However, with the recent housing market crash it&#8217;s becoming more common that people want to move but simply can&#8217;t afford to sell because they would lose money on the sale.  That is why I recommend everyone looking to sell their home should consider whether they should [sell or rent][2].  [That was the case with me][3], the current mortgage balance was more than I could sell the house for and I&#8217;d also need to cover closing costs and realtor commission.  To overcome this dilemma you can decide to still buy a new home and rent out the old one.  For this landlord success is different than the traditional landlord, it&#8217;s a question of how much you&#8217;re willing to spend on a new home. You&#8217;ll need to factor in your new mortgage payment and any potential losses from the rental and decide if that&#8217;s an acceptable investment in your new home.

## Owners Who May Foreclose

The last type of landlord is the one that is forced to downsize or move into a rental because they can&#8217;t afford their current mortgage.  Even though they can&#8217;t afford it, they may not want to lose the property to foreclosure so they decide to move and rent it.  This is a great alternative to foreclosure because it allows them to keep the asset and potentially use it again in the future or sell it once they&#8217;ve established equity in the property.  For this landlord success is defined by what you can afford. If you lose a couple hundred a month but move into a new place that allows you to afford that loss and still keep the house then you are being successful.

## Risk

Keep in mind that no matter what type of landlord you are there are always financial risks involved. You could have bad tenants that don&#8217;t pay their rent, destructive tenants that damage your place, or you could have difficulty finding tenants which could leave the place vacant and earning no income. It&#8217;s important to factor in these risks and understand how you&#8217;ll handle them if you choose to become a landlord.
