![House for Rent](/images/house_for_rent.jpg)

You have decided you want to rent your house, but you’re not sure exactly where to start. The process for converting a home into a rental is actually pretty straight forward and less complicated than you may expect. Here are the basic steps between deciding to rent your home and having tenants move in. These aren’t necessary listed in the order they need to be executed, I just recommend you complete everything on this list before renting.

## Move Out

If you are currently living in the house then naturally you’ll need to move out before you rent it. This step can happen towards the end of this process if you’re looking to minimize the vacancy time. When I first rented out my condo, I was fortunate enough to only have the property vacant for a few weeks.

## Legal

You’ll most likely need to do some paperwork to properly declare the property as a rental. For me it was just a form I had to fill out with my local township. You can call your town clerk’s office to find out your local requirements.

It’s also recommended that you check the terms of your mortgage. If you bought the property as a primary residence, there may be some requirements for how long the property must be used as a primary residence to keep your current interest rates. When I bought my condo it was my first time buying a home so I was able to get some first time homebuyer benefits. Because of that the loan terms stated that I needed to maintain the unit as a primary residence for at least one year.

## Maintenance and Setup

Once vacant, you’ll want to get the unit in the best shape possible. Perform any routine maintenance and repair anything that you’ve been putting off while you lived there. Fill all the nail holes and, if needed, apply fresh paint to the rooms. I also recommend that you thoroughly clean everywhere in the unit and get all the carpets professionally cleaned. If the thought of cleaning everything is too daunting, then look into hiring a cleaning company. Not only is this to make the place more appealing to renters, but also so you know that the unit started in a specific condition. You’ll need to document the unit’s condition before renters move in so that you can properly assess if you need to use any of their security deposit when they move out.

## Find Tenants

There are lots of ways to go about finding tenants. I recommend following my [9 Step Guide to Tenant Screening][1].  Be thorough with this process because your tenants will be living there for at least a year, if not more. After finding tenants, it’s a good idea to continue looking for other prospective tenants until the unit hold form is completed. This is to protect you in case something falls through.

## Fire Inspection

This may not be a requirement everywhere but be sure to ask the township clerk when you call about paperwork. This usually involves the local fire marshal inspecting the unit and ensuring it meets all fire regulations. They’ll provide you the list of requirements before they come which usually includes smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers.

## Lease Signing

After finding tenants you’ll want to get the lease signed as quickly as possible. You should already have a template written up that just needs to have the names and dates inserted. It’s also a good idea to collect the first month&#8217;s rent and security deposit at the lease signing. This ensures the tenants are both legally and financially committed to moving in.

## Tenants Move In / You’re a Landlord

Once everything else listed is done, you just wait for the move-in date. You’ll want to be there to give the tenants the keys and welcome them into their new home. And that’s all there is to it, you’re now a landlord.
