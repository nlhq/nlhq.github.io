## [What is a Successful Landlord?][1]

This raises an interesting question: What is a successful landlord?  Depending on your situation the definitions vary.  In [Reasons for Becoming a Landlord][1] we discuss each type of landlord and what success means for each.  It&#8217;s important you think about this upfront.  Deciding to become a landlord is a big decision and shouldn&#8217;t be rushed into.  Once you&#8217;ve defined your success criteria you&#8217;ll be able to make an educated decision about whether being a landlord is right for you.

## Property to Rent

Once you&#8217;ve decided that being a landlord is your best option, you&#8217;ll need property to rent.  In general that property comes from one of two sources.  The traditional landlord will purchase a piece of real estate specifically with the intention of renting it.  The second type of landlord is what the media has been characterizing as the &#8220;accidental landlord.&#8221;  This term is for individuals  who didn&#8217;t intend to become landlords when they bought property but given their current circumstances have decided to rent their home.  As mention above and in [Reasons for Becoming a Landlord][1] there are two primary categories of these people:

1.  Owners who fear foreclosure so renting allows them to keep the property
2.  Owners who are looking to move but can&#8217;t sell their current home without a substantial loss

Regardless of your reason, these people already have step one taken care of because they already own property.  This was my situation which you can read more about [here][2].

## [Renting Your Property][3]

Converting  your home to a rental is a fairly straightforward process and actually much simpler than you may expect.  In [How to Rent Your Home][3] we discuss the process of preparing your home and all the things you need to consider.  Usually it just involves cleaning the property and filling out some paperwork with your county.  The more challenging aspect of being a landlord is selecting and managing your tenants.

## [Tenant Screening][4]

Tenant selection can be the most difficult and stressful aspect of being a landlord.  However, it&#8217;s not impossible and can be handled with minimal stress when approached systematically.  That is why we&#8217;ve laid out a [9 Step Guide to Tenant Screening][4]. By following these 9 easy steps, you&#8217;ll be able to find quality tenants who will hopefully rent your property for many years.

When I first decided to rent out my condo, I was very stressed.  There were so many questions going through my head:

*   Can I find tenants?
*   Can I afford it?
*   What are the all my responsibilities?
*   How do I prep my property?

But quickly I realized it wasn&#8217;t as bad as I first imagined.  Anyone can be a landlord.  Deciding to become a landlord allowed my wife and I to move into the house we dreamed of so that we can ultimately raise a family here.  What is your motivation for wanting to become a landlord?  If you are serious about it, then take action today and get started.
