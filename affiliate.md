title: Affiliate Disclaimer

To help support this blog, when available I use affiliate programs for products that I use and recommend. You can be certain that the link would still be there if no affiliate program was available. I NEVER promote anything that I don't use personally. If, for any reason, I decide to stop using a product then I will remove the affiliate links from my site and provide an explanation why.

You are under no obligation to use these links, but if you do I will receive a small commission. If you decide to use them I thank you.

To be sure there is never confusion, I will always tag affiliate links with [\<AL>](/affiliate-disclosure) directly following the affiliate link which is a link back to this site.
