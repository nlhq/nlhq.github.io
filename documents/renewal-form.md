Towards the end of your tenant's lease you'll need to determine whether they'll be renewing the lease or moving out. Hopefully the past year (or whatever the lease term was) went smoothly and both parties would like them to stay. When this happens you have two option: write up a new lease or write up a lease renewal form that extends the current lease. I find the renewal form to be a convenient option as long as no major changes are required to the original lease.

The renewal form should cover the following items:

1. Signing Date
2. Tenant Name(s)
3. Landlord Name(s)
4. Property Address
5. Original Leases Dates
6. New Lease Dates
7. Statement that all original lease terms apply
8. New Rent Amount
9. Signatures

This all fits conveniently on a single page and is very easy to review and get signed. I recommend including a copy of the original lease with the extension so the tenants can refresh themselves on the terms.
