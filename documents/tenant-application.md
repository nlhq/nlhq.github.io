title: Tenant Application

Below you&#8217;ll find a free copy of our rental application form. At NewLandlordHQ we provide you with complete, ready-to-use documents. This rental application form is the one I personally use when screening potential tenants. It&#8217;s available in both PDF and MS Word formats so feel free to use as-is or modify it to meet your needs.

Finding tenants is one of the most critical, and stressful, parts of being a landlord. When searching for tenants it&#8217;s important to have a [clear process][1] which begins with a good rental application. The application is your opportunity to learn as much as you can about a potential tenant so you can make an educated decision based on your selection criteria.

## Parts of the Application

My application is divided into 10 parts. Below is an explanation of each part and a justification for why I want that information.

### 1. Applicant Information

This is general applicant information such as name, contact info, etc. Nothing too surprising. This section also asks about their current and previous residence including rent and landlord contact information. The rent can be used to gauge whether your unit is dramatically different (higher or lower) from their recent lifestyle. Big changes may be a red flag. Also the landlord contact info can be used to ask about the tenants. Although your mileage may vary and you may not use it, merely asking could help filter out some potentially bad tenants.

### 2. Employment Information

Next is their employment information. You want to know that they have a stable job and make enough to afford your rent comfortably. General rule of thumb is less than 30% of their pretax income should go to rent. Any more could be an indicator that they can&#8217;t really afford your place.

### 3. Emergency Contacts

This is mainly for future reference but can give you an idea of who else they know in the area.

### 4. Co-Applicant

This is all the same information if they&#8217;re married. Married qualifies if they can file their taxes together and share a credit score. Otherwise I require separate applications with separate applicant fees.

### 5. Occupants

A list of everyone that plans to live in the unit. You want to know exactly how many people are planning to live there to make sure it meets your units occupancy limits.

### 6. Financial

This is a series of questions to help you gauge their financial health prior to getting a credit score.

*   Do they have checking and savings accounts?
*   Have they filed for bankruptcy?
*   Have they been convicted of a felony?
*   Have they ever defaulted on a lease?

All of these things will help you develop a picture of the type of tenant they may be and if you feel comfortable that they will be reliable financially. You can also compare their answers to your background checks to better understand their honesty and trustworthiness.

### 7. Other Information

This is a customizable section to ask any other important questions that would restrict who you want as a tenant.

*   Do they have pets?
*   Do they have a waterbed?
*   Do they smoke?

Change as appropriate for your situation.

### 8. Vehicle Information

This section is not only so you&#8217;ll have their vehicle info if they move in. You can also compare their vehicle to their income. This can help you decide how they spend money. Is the price of the car appropriate for their income level? While you can&#8217;t reject a tenant because &#8220;They drive a nice car,&#8221; it is something to consider along with your other criteria.

### 9. Personal References

As with landlord references, your mileage may vary with using personal references but it&#8217;s good to have a list of contacts and you might find some insight from the people they include.

### 10. Agreement & Authorization

Finally comes the legal disclaimers which have the tenant state that everything they said is truthful. It also has them agree to pay the application fee. At the end of this section they sign and date the application.
