I&#8217;m very excited to announce the launch of [NewLandlordHQ][1]. My name is John and like many people today I was stuck with a home I couldn&#8217;t afford to sell. I decided to become a landlord and haven&#8217;t turned back since, read [my whole story here][2]. While being a landlord sounds complicated, it can actually be quite simple if you know what you&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ve launched this site to make it as easy as possible for new landlords to get started and feel comfortable with their decision. I will strive to provide the best information I possible can and answer all the questions I had when I was getting started. Please feel free to [send me questions][3] or place them below in the comments. The more interaction we have, the more people we can help. Thanks for reading!
