>  When it was time to move to the next property, I kept it. There were no stressful moving days for me. And guess what I did when I moved the next two times? I kept them as rentals, too.

This is how I came to be a landlord and so far it's worked out well for me. Similar to Dave, we had to save up more to move but we now have an investment for the future. I've now owned it for 8 years and so have 22 years left on my 30 year mortgage. If we decide to move again in the future it will certainly be compelling, however, that kinda down payment will be challenging to save up.
