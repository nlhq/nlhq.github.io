## About Me

My name is John. I’m 28, married with no kids, and live in New Jersey. Being employed as an electrical engineer, I never saw myself getting into real estate. But when a new housing opportunity arose, renting my two-bedroom, two-story condo became a sensible reality for me. Given today’s real estate climate, I’m probably not alone.

## How I Became a Landlord

After I graduated from college, I decided to buy a condo close to my new job. I thought I was being smart. I thought, “Why throw away money on rent when I could buy a place of my own and build equity?” Maybe under different economic circumstances that would’ve been right. Unfortunately that was in 2007, right at the peak of the real estate market when prices were high.

I lived in the condo for two years and happily called it home. During that time, I got engaged. As the wedding approached, my fiance and I decided we wanted to start our lives together in a single-family home. Conveniently, the [Federal First-Time Homebuyer Credit][1] was available to aid new homebuyers (like my fiance). With the tax credit as extra motivation, we excitedly began the process of looking. But we had one major issue; the housing market had just CRASHED. We met with our realtor, and it was quickly apparent we couldn’t possibly sell the condo. Its value had dropped in the past two years and was worth far less than what I still owed on my mortgage.

While we were disappointed, all hope was not lost. Our realtor told us we could still purchase a new home if we rented the condo. Not only would renting help us to buy a house, it would also serve as a valuable investment. After weighing our options, we proceeded looking for a bigger place with the hope that we could make the condo an investment property.

Since the condo was close to my job, I decided to send out an email to see if anyone at work would be interested in renting for the next year. I had a response within 24 hours and things began rolling. Deciding to rent to my co-worker was an easy decision because I knew she had a good job and would take care of the place. Two months later we bought a house and began renting the condo.

My wife and I have continued to rent the condo since 2009 and have been incredibly happy with our decision. While you can choose your level of involvement with your rental property, I made the conscious effort to be a very hands-on landlord. I manage the property myself, complete my own taxes (with the help of TurboTax), and only use my realtor as a last resort. I have learned a lot during my time as a landlord and want to share my experiences so that I can help others in my situation.

## Why I Made this Website

Being a landlord is neither as daunting or time-consuming as one might think. It actually is quite easy. All you need to do is be informed about the process. When I started renting my condo, it was hard to find references for landlords &#8211; particularly those new to it all. I decided to create this website to help guide new and prospective landlords and establish a forum where we can learn from one another.

You can count on NewLandlordHQ to be your single resource for all of the information, tools, and support you need to be a successful landlord.
